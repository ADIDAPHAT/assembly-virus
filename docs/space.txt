- use a register to store 0 and use it to pass 0 parameters to methods!
- for loading small values in a register use:
    push  byte 13 ; takes 3 bytes
    pop   eax
- RIP-relative memory operand
	default rel
	mov eax, [mem]
- XCHG EAX,reg32 takes only 1 byte
- The following instructions take one byte less when they use the accumulator than when they use any other register: ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, AND, OR, XOR, CMP, TEST with an immediate operand without sign extension
